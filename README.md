# Your Project Name

Brief description of your project.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose (for containerized setup)
- Python 3.8+ (for non-Docker backend setup)
- Node.js 14+ (for non-Docker frontend setup)

### Installation and Running the Application

#### Using Docker Compose (Recommended)

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepository.git
   cd yourrepository
   ```

2. Build and start the containers:
   ```
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

   This will start both the backend and frontend services.

#### Without Docker Compose

If you prefer to run the services directly on your machine:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepository.git
   cd yourrepository
   ```

2. Set up and run the backend:
   ```
   cd backend
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   python app.py  # Or the appropriate command to start your backend server
   ```

3. In a new terminal, set up and run the frontend:
   ```
   cd frontend
   npm install
   npm start
   ```

## Running the tests

### Using Docker Compose

To run the tests using pytest through Docker Compose:

```
docker-compose run --rm test
```

This command will run all tests in the test suite.

To run specific test files or directories:

```
docker-compose run --rm test pytest path/to/test_file.py
```

To run tests with additional pytest options:

```
docker-compose run --rm test pytest -v -s
```

### Without Docker Compose

To run the tests directly on your machine:

1. Ensure you're in the backend directory and your virtual environment is activated.

2. Install test dependencies:
   ```
   pip install pytest
   ```

3. Run the tests:
   ```
   pytest
   ```

   To run specific test files or directories:
   ```
   pytest path/to/test_file.py
   ```

   To run tests with additional pytest options:
   ```
   pytest -v -s
   ```

## Development

### Backend

The backend service is a Python application (likely using Flask or Django).

To make changes to the backend:

1. Edit the files in the `backend/` directory.
2. If using Docker, the changes will be reflected immediately due to volume mounting.
3. If running directly, you may need to restart the backend server to see changes.

### Frontend

The frontend service is a JavaScript application (likely using React, Vue, or Angular).

To make changes to the frontend:

1. Edit the files in the `frontend/` directory.
2. The changes should be reflected immediately in both Docker and non-Docker setups, thanks to hot-reloading.

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system.
